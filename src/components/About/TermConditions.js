              <h3 className="title-faq">Booking Time</h3>
              <p className="content-faq">Takapic serves as a reservation system for photographers. By booking a photographer for example from 11am to 2pm, you only have him/her available for you during those 2 hours. If you choose to travel from point A to B, that will be part of the 2-hour reservation. Travellers must arrive at the meeting point on time or 15 minutes before to meet photographer. If travellers are late, the photoshoot session time will still run as scheduled unless photographer is available after the assigned time. If for any reason travellers fail to notify the photographer and arrive maximum 30 minutes after the photoshoot session time, travellers will be considered as a no-show and be charged the full fee.</p>
              <p className="content-faq">For any rescheduling or cancellation requests, travellers can notify Takapic through email. Cancellations made at least 3 days before the photoshoot will get a 90% refund from the package price. Cancellations made less than 3 days before the photoshoot will not be entitled to any refund.</p>
