						It was once lonely, but it is no more. Thirty years ago, the Gili Island was uninhabited and only discovered by the seafaring Bugis people from Sulawesi. It was only a matter of time before the adventurous backpackers discovered the islands and developed Gili into a getaway destination. In the Sasak language, Gili means small islands, and there are approximately thirty Gilis around the island of Lombok. The main islets that build up Gili Island altogether, Gili Trawangan, Gili Meno, and Gili Air, are amassing more visitors, gaining popularity following its neighboring island, Bali, and its mother island, Lombok. They have become a much loved itinerary for visitors hopping from Bali looking for new adventures.

					<p>
						In Gili, the beaches are still powdery white, the pristine turquoise seawaters are home to more than 3500 marine species including reef sharks, turtles, pygmy seahorses and colorful corals. They are also positioned perfectly for sunsets over Bali’s Mount Agung and sunrise over Lombok’s Mount Rinjani. You won’t see any cars or motorbikes here, since all forms of motorized transport are still not allowed in the Gilis. It means that the only way to get around is on foot, by bicycle and in horse carts known as cidomos. The Gilis are also deemed as one of the best diving and snorkeling spots as well as learning-to dive destinations in the world.

						Bali also has the whole package of tropical features, thanks to its volcanic nature, among of them are tall mountains, wild jungles, and lush rice terraces. Being not far of the equator, Bali has a fairly even climate all year round. Tip: the high season in Bali is during the dry season in July until September and again during Christmas, New Year, and Easter holiday in April. Outside these peak seasons, Bali can be surprisingly quiet and hotels often offer good discounts for the stay. The downside of these low seasons is that it happens during rainy season. And although the rainfall is usually not excessive, you might have to cut out some activities like mountain treks during these times.
					</p> 
					<br/>
					<h5 className="section-title">GILI TRAWANGAN</h5>
					<p>
						Gili Trawangan lies furthest from its mother island, Lombok, but larger in size compared to its two other twins, Gili Meno and Gili Air. Since it is the most developed of the Gilis, Gili Trawangan provides more entertainment for visitors and has gained the reputation as vibrant party-island amongt the others.
					</p>

					<p>
						In here, chill party seekers come here to enjoy the great nightlife in restaurants, bars, and beach clubs. There are many beach bars with live bands that will provide the perfect soundtrack for your night. There is even a cinema straw hut that will bring you a novel experience in watching movies. The crowd camps on the southern part of the island where the partying hotpots and lively bars are, so if you need a quieter ambience, you can head further north and west of the island to find more quiet and serene beaches to relax.
					</p> 

					<br/>
					<h5 className="section-title">The Giant Swing</h5>
					<p>
						Who would not know the iconic giant swing that might have decorated the internet world as the face of Gili? The first ocean swing in Gili Trawangan, Datu Swing, is even more popular than Gili Trawangan itself, located on the high-end Hotel Ombak Sunset. Since the construction of Datu Swing, others ocean swing began to surfacing in all corners of not only Gili Trawangan but also the other Gilis. 
					</p> 
					<img className="img-content" src="/images/blog/gili/giantswing.png"></img>
					<span className="img-source">Source: blog.freepeople.com</span>
					<p>
						The name Datu is the traditional name for the highest royal caste in Lombok. As you witness the beauty and awe of the magnificent sun setting behind the grand Mount Agung blessing the world in a gentle, warm orange glow of rays, you can’t feel any safer and sound with no worries, swinging up to the sky.
					</p> 

					<br/>
					<h5 className="section-title">The Hill Viewpoint</h5>
					<p>
						Often overlooked due to its less partying vibe, this landmark is historically important since it stood to witness the WWII as naval army base and lookout post. Nowadays, it is renowned as best sunset-view spot in the island. 
					</p> 
					<img className="img-content" src="/images/blog/gili/hillviewpoint.png"></img>

					<p>
						Under thick foliage is the run-down remnant of a Japanese machinegun bunker, giving a more eerie and mysterious atmosphere both to the locals and tourists. It was said that the Japanese had built a tunnel that functioned as tunnel throughout the hill. Trawangan itself means ‘tunnel’ in the local tongue, so we should not miss the significance this hill had brought to the island.
					</p> 

					<br/>
					<h5 className="section-title">The Lighthouse</h5>
					<p>
						Located to the north of the island lies the Gili ocean swing, but if you’re making your way for sunset in the west, you will notice a perimeter fence guarding a lighthouse looking out to sea. As the gate is very rarely closed, you are invited to the best seats in the house to watch the sun go down. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Although the steps leading up to the top might test your bravery, it will all worth it when you gasp in awe of the splendid natural view you have in your sight. From this viewpoint, you are able to get 360-degree panoramas of all three Gili Islands, to Lombok in the South, and Bali in the North.
					</p> 

					<br/>
					<h5 className="section-title">GILI MENO</h5>
					<p>
						The smallest of the three Gilis, only 2 km long and 3 km wide, Gili Meno is praised as the sanctuary for newlywed couple in their honeymoon. It also sets itself apart from the other two islands, Gili Trawangan and Gili Air, both in terms of features and characteristics. The population is equally small, and the banning of late night partying actually helps to make the island a perfect place to unwind and relax.
					</p> 
					<img className="img-content" src="/images/blog/gili/gilimeno.png"></img>
					<span className="img-source">Source: bali-indonesia.com</span>
					<p>
						Gili Meno offers more preserved nature, so it is the place to get away from the tiresome city life and marvel at the untouched beaches and indulge in pure island life. Gili Meno serves as an ultimate choice for an escape, suits nature lovers best, as well as honeymooners and couples looking for privacy, and absolute rest and relaxation.
					</p> 

					<br/>
					<h5 className="section-title">Karma Beach</h5>
					<p>
						Karma Beach is a stylish beach club on the eastern coast of Gili Meno, featuring an all-bamboo structure and two-layered grass-roofed rotunda, complementing the beachscape of the Karma Reef with its cozy wooden beachside huts. Similar to its twin establishment in Bali, Karma Beach Gili Meno is present to ensure that you can still experience the hype of luxurious resorts in this secluded island.

					<br/>
					<h5 className="section-title">Bird Park Resort</h5>
					<p>
						Located in the middle of the island, the Bird Park not only houses three hundred tropical birds but also reptiles. It is a small, privately owned sanctuary that adjoins a small hotel of the same name. The Bird Park serves as main attraction and gives an exotic experience in low-key Gili Meno.

					<br/>
					<h5 className="section-title">Saltwater Lake</h5>
					<p>
						Within only a minute’s walk westward from the Bird Park, you will find the large and unique saltwater lake with its occasional spotting of tropical birds and wildlife. The lake and its perimeters are locally referred to as 'Kawasan Ekowisata Mangrove Gili Meno', a mangrove ecotourism area as a whole. Located near the mid-western half of the island, the lake is easily reached on a 10-minute leisurely stroll from the main boat docks on Gili Meno’s east coast.

					<br/>
					<h5 className="section-title">Gili AIR</h5>
					<p>
						A delightful cross between the two different worlds, the lively and social Gili Trawangan, and peaceful Gili Meno; Gili Air has become the subject to gradual development from time to time. This very small island can be toured by foot in just one hour, which is ideal since there are no cars or motorcycles.
					</p> 
					<img className="img-content" src="/images/blog/gili/giliair.png"></img>
					<span className="img-source">Source: gilibookings.com</span>
					<p>
						At Gili Air, you get a mixture of everything; the perfect balance of a hip lifestyle and rustic atmosphere in the south and more isolated beaches in the north. Gili Air is also acknowledged for having more natural seabeds than its bigger counterpart, Gili Trawangan. Gili Air’s proximity to the mainland, positioned at the string of the three Gilis, also makes it a popular stepping stone for those heading to Lombok.
					</p> 

					<br/>
					<h5 className="section-title">Gili Air Escape</h5>
					<p>
						Gili Air Escape is a resort of ten minutes’ walk from harbor area. The harbor area is sort of the down town of Gili Air, and it is always bustling with people from all different walks of life. Gili Air Escape has a brilliant location, the quiet neighborhood makes laying at the pool feel like having the whole island for yourself, and the beach is about five minutes’ walk. This is actually the part of the island where one can find the beautiful and peaceful beaches and access the scuba diving locations.

					<br/>
					<h5 className="section-title">Gili Air Hans Reef</h5>
					<p>
						This reef is known for its large collection of interesting sea creatures as well, such as the rare frog fish. This site is just off the east of Gili Air and provides a great opportunity to see very unusual marine life. Hans Reef is a good training site as it has a shallow sandy section with lines and buoys, and also offers a great experience for underwater photographers to take pictures of stranger kinds of sea creatures.
