						As many people might know, Belitung is an island on the east coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, as part of the province of Bangka Belitung Islands. But only a few might know that it was once famous for its tin mines and smaller offshore islands rounded by granite boulders, white sand beaches, and turquoise blue sea. Not only is it renowned for its natural treasures, Belitung has a lot more to offer, particularly for you who may be looking for a tranquil escape from the hustle of big city life.

It is located approximately 30 kilometers away or around one hour’s drive from Tanjung Pandan. But  do not worry, for the route is fairly smooth and there are sufficient directions that lead you there safely. The beach itself is typical Belitung’s granite boulders neatly arranged along the stretch with white sands bordering the clear blue sea.  It’s no wonder that Tanjung Tinggi has become favorite destination for travellers looking for charming photograph spots; it is everywhere!

					<p>
						Lengkuas Island is one of offshore islands in Belitung. You have to sail by the boat from the main island to this humble little island, a less than one hectare land. This island is specifically famous for its 129-year-old metal lighthouse that stands approximately 50 meters in height. Built during Dutch colonial era, the lighthouse still functions today to guide ships through and out of the island despite its old tenure. Although it is not always allowed to ascend to the highest peak of the lighthouse, every level has windows facing to every direction that shows picturesque view of the sea and its roundabouts. Other than its breath-taking scenery, Lengkuas Island also offers wild animal potentials, such as lizards and turtle captive breeding. The island is praised as the best site for swimming and snorkeling, as the water is so transparent that you can see through the colorful fish or various kinds and pristine coral reefs underneath. The moderately calm and shallow water will also tempt you not to wait a second longer to jump right into the sea!

					<p>
						Before you can get to Lengkuas Island mentioned above, you have to set sail from Tanjung Kelayang Beach across the blue sea to the offshore island. Tanjung Kelayang itself is a peninsula that juts toward north with Kelayang granite island on the east. It is located approximately 27 kilometers away from the town of Tanjung Pandan. Tanjung Kelayang is also connected to Tanjung Tinggi Beach as far as 4 kilometers stretch. This beach offers panoramic views of the blue sea, swaying palm trees, low tides, and gentle tropical breeze and other activities such as visiting uninhibited islands nearby (by taking boat first), fishing and tasting the freshly caught fish which are widely sold around the beach. Important note: Tanjung Kelayang is not only popular as a tourist destination, it is also a regular venue for events such as diving race, maritime festival, kite competitions, ASEAN level beach volley tournament, etc. Do check on the schedule!

					<h5 className="img-title">Kaolin Lake</h5>

					<span className="img-source">Source: dakatour.com</span>
					<p>
						What makes Kaolin Lake such an attractive tourist destination is the fact that this is not a natural lake which is normally derived from crater! This lake started off as a ‘kaolin’ (mineral clay) mining site in Belitung but later abandoned and discovered by photographers that entice more visitors to come. Unlike other natural lakes, Kaolin Lake was formed from the rain water reserved in the former mining area, and although it is as blue as the ocean, it is neither salty nor sulphuric. The lake has the depth of around 30 meters (100 feet). There are two major lakes; the right side which is blue and the left side which is greener in shade with excavated piles around the lake that resemble white hills (you would rather put your favourite sneakers away unless you want your shoes to get all white!). Although visitors are now restricted to go down any further due to safety reason, you can get beautiful pictures on a dry and sunny day. It is a point of interest that is near the airport, so a quick stop should do the trick. Pro tip: It is a camera-friendly spot and favorite pre-wedding photo-shoot location, so bring up your best gear along!

					<span className="img-source">Source: google.com</span>
					<p>
						Bukit Berahu Resort is a fusion of both bungalow and restaurant on the shore of a beautiful beach. This resort has three main stay options including villas, bungalow, and cottages. The beach itself is part of the resort but is hidden on the foothills of Bukit Berahu and to get to the site you have to descend 97 steps of stairs. Due to its hidden location, the beach offers semi-private and peaceful atmosphere with amazing view which render it as a perfect place for couples to go on honeymoon or family to spend some quality time together. Bukit Berahu is a popular choice for travellers since guests can enjoy easy access to the city's must-see destinations, such as Tanjung Tinggi Beach. This is indeed an ultimate choice for a memorable stay in Belitung.

					<span className="img-source">Source: indonesiakaya.com</span>
					<p>
						Museum Kata (Museum of Words) was built by Andrea Hirata, the author of bestseller book ‘Laskar Pelangi’ which tells the true story of local children striving to achieve their dreams. This museum is the first (and the only) literature museum in Indonesia and the collections are mostly of the Laskar Pelangi story itself and other personal pieces of Andrea Hirata. Museum Kata was built to inspire more youths in Gantong village, where the author was born and raised, to develop their artistic talents and interests. Aside from its literary value, Museum Kata shall be on your go-to-list for its vintage and colorful interior. You have to buy a book worth 50,000 IDR (a two-version pocket edition of Laskar Pelangi) in exchange of your entry fee. Inside the museum there is a kitchenette serving light bites and coffee. If you are into literature, this place is a must for you, and if you are not, then you can still enjoy yourself with plenty of interesting photo spots.
